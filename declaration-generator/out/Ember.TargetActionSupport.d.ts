    `Ember.TargetActionSupport` is a mixin that can be included in a class
    to add a `triggerAction` method with semantics similar to the Handlebars
    `{{action}}` helper. In normal Ember usage, the `{{action}}` helper is
    usually the best choice. This mixin is most often useful when you are
    doing more complex event handling in Components.
